  <p><strong>Campaign Manager</strong> automatically calculates the current status of each campaign based on the status names and rules configured here. The status 'rule' tells what status to assign based on the start and end dates of a given campaign.</p>
  <p>The status rules provided by default may be sufficient for your organization. However, you can easily change the status names and/or adjust the rules by clicking the Edit links below.</p>
